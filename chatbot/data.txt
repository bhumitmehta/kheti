The state is targeting to produce seeds worth Rs 3,000 crore annually.The seed parks will be developed under the public-private partnership (PPP) model, covering an estimated 1,200 hectares across the state. Currently, UP spends Rs 3,000 crore each year importing seeds for major cash crops such as paddy, wheat, pulses, maize, barley, and oilseeds from other states.These seed parks will help reduce our annual seed procurement bill and also generate employment in rural areas, the official said.The seed parks will be spread across the states five regions: Western UP, Terai (Himalayan foothills), Central UP, Bundelkhand, and Eastern UP, each designed to suit the regions specific agro-climatic conditions.Six government farms, already equipped with basic facilities, were identified for such parks. These farms will be leased to PPP partners, with smaller seed parks covering 200-300 hectares and larger ones exceeding 400 hectares.UP, with Indias largest cultivable land area of 16.6 million hectares  over 80 per cent of which is irrigated  currently imports hybrid seeds primarily from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The state imports a significant percentage of seeds: 22 per cent of wheat, 51 per cent of paddy, 74 per cent of maize, 95 per cent of barley, 50 per cent of pulses, and 52 per cent of oilseeds.Despite its fertile land and extensive irrigation, UP lags in per-hectare yields, owing to outdated farming practices and the use of low-quality seeds. For example, wheat production in the state is 26.75 quintals per hectare, compared to Punjabs 40.35 quintals, and paddy production in UP is 37.35 quintals per hectare, compared to Haryanas 45.33 quintals. Improved seed quality could increase yields by 15-20 per cent.
